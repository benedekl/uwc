This is a collection of the 'unique word count' implemented in many languages.

## Introduction

All software should read stdin, parse all words in it, and count their
occurence. Then sort the words by their occurence and lexicogrphically, and
print the word and its occurence line-by-line.

Words should be matched by the regular expression [a-z']+ case insensitive.
